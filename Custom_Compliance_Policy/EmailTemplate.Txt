    Action Required — Your Device Is Not Compliant with Security Standards
Hello [FirstName],

Our systems have detected that your Windows device ([Device Name]) is currently not compliant with [Company Name]’s security and update readiness policies. This means your device may not be receiving the latest updates or may not be functioning properly with our management platform (Intune).

To protect your data and ensure continued access to company services (like email, Teams, SharePoint, etc.), your device must meet certain health and configuration standards.

🚨 Why Is My Device Non-Compliant?

Your device may be marked non-compliant for one or more of the following reasons:

Issue	What It Means	Why It Matters
🔄 Pending Restart	Your device has updates or settings that require a reboot.	Important updates won’t complete without a restart.
💾 Low Disk Space (C:\ ≤ 5GB)	Your system drive is running low on free space.	Updates may fail or system performance may degrade.
🔧 Critical Service Not Running	One or more services (like Windows Update or Intune Management Extension) are disabled or stopped.	Your device can’t communicate properly with IT systems or download updates.
🛑 Update Settings Misconfigured	Some update settings (like update deferral or pause) are blocking updates.	Your device may miss critical security patches.
✅ What Do I Need to Do?

To bring your device back into compliance, please follow these steps:

🔁 1. Restart Your Device

If you haven't rebooted in a while, restart your machine. This often resolves pending update or service issues.

💽 2. Free Up Disk Space

Ensure your C:\ drive has at least 6 GB of free space:

Delete unnecessary files (Downloads, Temp folders).

Use Disk Cleanup (type Disk Cleanup in Start Menu).

Empty Recycle Bin.

⚙️ 3. Check Services

Ensure the following Windows services are running:

If you're not comfortable doing this, contact the IT team for help.

🛠️ 4. Reset Update Settings (Optional)

Some update features might be paused or delayed.
You can check by going to:

Settings > Windows Update

Remove any pause or deferral settings.
