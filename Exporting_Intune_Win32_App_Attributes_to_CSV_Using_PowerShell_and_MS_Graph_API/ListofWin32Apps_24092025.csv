Whether you're at home, in the office, or on the go, your notes are available to you on all your devices. 

-- Capture anything -- 
Take a picture of the whiteboard in a meeting with auto-cropping and photo enhancements. Add your PowerPoint presentation or PDF for school. Clip website articles using iOS share extension.

-- Powerful organization -- 
Organize your notes in a way that works best for you. Create, rename, search, sort, and copy pages, sections, and notebooks. Find your most recent notes quickly and pin the pages you use most. Secure your notes with a password and use touch ID to quickly access them.

Share your notes with your friends and colleagues. Whether it's a party your planning with others, or a school project you’re working on with your group. Work together in a shared notebook at the same time. 

-- Always with you -- 
Access your notes on your Mac, iPhone, iPad and other devices. Your notes are synced to the cloud (OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint) making it easy to access your recipe notes on your iPhone at the store, your homework on your Mac in class, or your itinerary on your iPad during your trip.

"Microsoft OneNote",,"CREATE YOUR WAY
Type, hand write, draw, and clip things from the web to get down your thoughts into your notebook. Use OneNote's flexible canvas to place content anywhere you want. You can even scan hand written notes or pages straight into OneNote then make them searchable. 

GET ORGANIZED
OneNote is set up like a notebook to bring the familiar physical 3-ring binder to the digital era. Easily use sections and pages to separate out thoughts by theme at school, home or work. Not sure where you categorized something? Use our powerful search to look across all of your notebooks or just the page you're on to find what you're looking for, even words on pages you scanned into your notes. You can use tags to label to-do lists, follow up items, mark what's important or make custom labels. Use OneNote as a notebook, journal or a notepad. Organize in one place, from anyplace. 

COLLABORATE WITH ANYONE
Share your notebook with whomever you want, such as your colleagues or family, and work on your projects together. OneNote syncs your notes across all devices and lets multiple people work on the content together, at the same time. Leave comments or tags to people to ask follow up questions, draw up your ideas, plan and journal the family vacation or check off the to-do list. 

ACCOMPLISH MORE AT WORK
OneNote is great on your own or when you share with a team. Use it as a notepad for team meetings, brainstorming projects, draw attention to important points or organize key resources to never lose track of what you need. Work together in real time to stay in sync and on the same page. You can log in with 2 accounts at the same time to seamlessly move from work to personal and back. OneNote is available across your favorite devices, no matter what your team likes to use --Android, Apple or Windows-- you can still work together to get more done. 

ACHIEVE MORE IN SCHOOL
OneNote is great for school for both students and teachers. Take your notes during class with ease, mixing in text, ink, and web clippings. Use OneNote to organize your brainstorms, draw mind maps and develop your ideas for your next school assignment. As a teacher, plan your lessons and have all the information you need right in your pocket and on the go. 

BETTER TOGETHER WITH OFFICE
OneNote is part of the Office family and works great with your favorite apps, such as Excel or Word to help you do more. 

NOTES AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
Use the OneNote badge as a notepad to list your thoughts down no matter when something crosses your mind. The badge hovers on screen and lets you quickly write your thoughts down during a phone call, while on the web or wherever else your mind takes you. In addition to the badge you can launch OneNote from a home screen widget or pin a notebook or page straight to the home screen helping you dive in faster, right where you want.
